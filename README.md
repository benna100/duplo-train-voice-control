# Control duplo train with voice pitch

Control the speed of your duplo train with your voice pitch ðŸŽ‰

## Installation

Simply open the index.html file in your browser or go to https://benna100.github.io/duplo-train-voice-control/

## Contribution

I originally created this project using node to connect to the train. I posted about it on Hackernews and this HackerNews user's comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31610813 made me discard the node part. So now the browser connects to the train which is a lot easier fx on your phone. The only problem is it only works on Chrome because of bluetooth support
